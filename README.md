## 👋 About Me
I am a Master's student in AI at San Jose State University, specializing in **Autonomous Systems**, **Agentic AI**, and **Edge Deployment**. I bridge the gap between high-level reasoning (LLMs) and low-level hardware optimization (TensorRT/CUDA).

## 🚀 Featured AI Projects

### [SAM-E: Multi-Agent Enrollment Assistant](https://github.com/HenryNVP/strategic_planning_AI.git)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, LangGraph, Docker, FastAPI
* **Summary:** Architected a microservices-based agentic system with three services (Agent, RAG, Enrollment Engine) using Docker Compose and LangGraph to route user intents to specialized tools. Developed a retrieval pipeline using pgvector to support academic queries, with planned integration of a Neo4j knowledge graph; demonstrated functionality via FastAPI, JWT authentication, and Prometheus metrics.

### [AI Tutor: RAG-Powered Learning Platform](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ai-tutor.git)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, MCP, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK
* **Summary:** Built a full-stack multi-agent educational system that ingests documents to generate cited answers, adaptive quizzes, and lesson notes via a source-filtered RAG pipeline using ChromaDB. Implemented an MCP server and secure Python execution with FastAPI backend, enabling structured tool use, real-time data visualization from CSVs, and adaptive learning features that track student progress.

### [ROS2 BEV-Fusion: Real-Time 3D Perception](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ros2-bevfusion-jetson.git)
* **Tech:** Python, ROS2, TensorRT, CUDA, Jetson, Edge AI
* **Summary:** Developed an optimized BEVFusion 3D perception pipeline for multi-camera and LiDAR fusion, validated on NuScenes and deployed as a modular ROS2 package. Optimized end-to-end inference with TensorRT and quantization, achieving ~7 FPS for the full BEVFusion pipeline on Jetson Orin Nano and publishing ROS2 detection outputs with latency metrics.

## 💼 Additional Projects

* **FastViT Mobile Optimization:** Optimized Vision Transformers using Performer attention (O(N) complexity) and knowledge distillation, achieving 90.1% accuracy @ 43ms on Android with stage freezing for transfer learning.
* **3D Object Detection Pipeline:** Built a 3D object detection inference pipeline using MMDetection3D (PointPillars, SECOND, CenterPoint) for KITTI and nuScenes, focusing on model evaluation, visualization, and deployment analysis.
* **Image Classification:** Developed a flexible image classification pipeline with timm, enabling YAML-based training and benchmarking of CNN and ViT architectures on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset.
* **Anime RecSys:** Benchmarked Two-Tower vs. NeuMF architectures with multiple objectives (MSE, ApproxNDCG); deployed best model via FastAPI with sub-50ms latency.
