## 👋 About Me
I am a Master's student in AI at San Jose State University, specializing in **Autonomous Systems**, **Agentic AI**, and **Edge Deployment**. I bridge the gap between high-level reasoning (LLMs) and low-level hardware optimization (TensorRT/CUDA).

## 🚀 Featured AI Projects

### 🎓 [SAM-E: Multi-Agent Enrollment Assistant](https://github.com/HenryNVP/strategic_planning_AI)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, LangGraph, Docker, FastAPI
* **Summary:** Architected a microservices-based agentic system with three services (Agent, RAG, Enrollment Engine) using Docker Compose and LangGraph. Developed a retrieval pipeline using **pgvector** to support academic queries and demonstrated functionality via a production-ready **FastAPI** backend with JWT authentication and Prometheus metrics.

### 🤖 [AI Tutor: RAG-Powered Learning Platform](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ai-tutor)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, MCP, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK
* **Summary:** Built a full-stack multi-agent educational system that ingests documents to generate cited answers and adaptive quizzes. Engineered a **source-filtered RAG pipeline** (320x faster retrieval) and a secure Python execution sandbox for real-time data visualization from user CSVs.

### 🚗 [ROS2 BEV-Fusion: Real-Time 3D Perception](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ros2-bevfusion-jetson)
* **Tech:** Python, ROS2, TensorRT, CUDA, Jetson, Edge AI
* **Summary:** Developed an optimized BEVFusion 3D perception pipeline for multi-camera and LiDAR fusion. Optimized end-to-end inference with **TensorRT and FP16 quantization**, achieving **~7 FPS** on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and publishing synchronized ROS2 detection messages.
