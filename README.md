## About Me

I am a Master's student in AI at San Jose State University, specializing in **Autonomous Systems**, **Agentic AI**, and **Edge Deployment**. I bridge the gap between high-level reasoning (LLMs) and low-level hardware optimization (TensorRT/CUDA).

## Featured AI Projects

### 🤖 [AI Tutor: RAG-Powered Learning Platform](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ai-tutor)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, MCP, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK
* **Summary:** Built a full-stack **multi-agent** educational system that ingests documents to generate cited answers, adaptive quizzes, and lesson notes via a source-filtered **RAG** pipeline using **ChromaDB**. Implemented an **MCP server** and secure Python execution with **FastAPI** backend, enabling structured tool use, real-time data visualization from CSVs, and adaptive learning features that track student progress.

### 🚗 [ROS2 BEV-Fusion: Real-Time 3D Perception](https://github.com/HenryNVP/ros2-bevfusion-jetson)
* **Tech:** Python, ROS2, TensorRT, CUDA, Jetson, Edge AI
* **Summary:** Developed an optimized **BEVFusion** 3D perception pipeline for multi-camera and LiDAR fusion, validated on NuScenes and deployed as a modular **ROS2** package. Optimized end-to-end inference with **TensorRT** and quantization, achieving **~7 FPS** for the full BEVFusion pipeline on Jetson Orin Nano and publishing **ROS2** detection outputs with latency metrics.

### 📱 [FastViT Mobile Optimization](https://github.com/HenryNVP/fastvit-pet-mobile)
* **Tech:** PyTorch, Android, Quantization, Knowledge Distillation
* **Summary:** Re-architected FastViT by replacing Multi-Head Attention with **Performer Attention** (**O(N)**) and implementing **FP16 quantization**, achieving a **4.8x speedup** on Android with **identical Top-1 accuracy**.

### 🎓 [SAM-E: Agentic Enrollment System](https://github.com/HenryNVP/strategic_planning_AI)
* **Tech:** GenAI, RAG, LangGraph, Docker, FastAPI
* **Summary:** Architected a microservices-based agentic system with three services (Agent, RAG, Enrollment Engine) using **Docker Compose** and **LangGraph** to route user intents to specialized tools. Developed a retrieval pipeline using **pgvector** to support academic queries, with planned integration of a **Neo4j** knowledge graph; demonstrated functionality via **FastAPI**, **JWT authentication**, and **Prometheus** metrics.
